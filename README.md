# doublet_opt
## Optimization of a doublet phase mask that can generates 2D spatial projection from 1D SLM
The repo is based on Pytorch to optimize the phase mask. 
Currently, the model is based on [Opt. Lett. 46, 2280-2283 (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1364/OL.419419) by James E. M. Whitehead et al.
My version of model will be updated soon.
